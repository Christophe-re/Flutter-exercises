The [Cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook) gives some recipes for common use-cases.

The "From another platform?" section can be really useful if you have experience in another platform:
- [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs)
- [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/ios-devs)
